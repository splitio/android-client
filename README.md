## Compatibility
This SDK is compatible with Android SDK versions 15 and later (4.0.3 Ice Cream Sandwich).

## Getting started
Below is a simple example that describes the instantiation and most basic usage of our SDK:
```
String sdkKey = "YOUR_SDK_KEY";
SplitClientConfig config = SplitClientConfig.builder()
        .build();
// User Key
String matchingKey = "CUSTOMER_ID";
Key key = new Key(matchingKey);

SplitClient splitClient = null;
try {
    // Create a Split factory
    SplitFactory splitFactory = SplitFactoryBuilder.build(sdkKey, key, config, getApplicationContext());
    // Get Split Client instance
    splitClient = splitFactory.client();
} catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}

final SplitClient client = splitClient;
splitClient.on(SplitEvent.SDK_READY, new SplitEventTask(){

    public void onPostExecution(SplitClient client) {
        Log.i("TAG", "Do some NO UI work");
        String treatment = client.getTreatment("FEATURE_FLAG_NAME");

        if (treatment.equals("on")) {
            Log.i("TAG", "I'm ON    ");
        } else if (treatment.equals("off")) {
            Log.i("TAG", "I'm OFF");
        } else {
            Log.i("TAG", "CONTROL was returned, there was an error");
        }
    }

    public void onPostExecutionView(SplitClient client) {
        Log.i("TAG", "Do some UI work");
    }

});
```
